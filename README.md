# TASK DESCRIPTION:

     In this fun and interactive task, I built a simple rule-based chatbot using Python that acts as a friendly conversational assistant. The goal is to introduce the core programming concepts of functions, loops, if-elif conditions, and input/output handling, all wrapped in a real-world mini-project that feels alive and interactive.

The chatbot begins with a set of predefined responses to common phrases like “hello”, “how are you”, “what is your name”, or “bye”. It responds instantly with relevant replies such as “Hi there!” or “I’m doing great, thanks!”. These built-in rules simulate the behavior of a basic customer support or help desk bot.

But what makes this chatbot even more exciting is its learning capability. If a user types something the bot doesn’t understand, it politely asks if they would like to teach it a response. If the user agrees, the chatbot stores the new phrase and its reply — instantly expanding its vocabulary for the current session. This turns the project into a smart, evolving chatbot without needing artificial intelligence.

From a learning perspective, this task reinforces:

Conditional logic (using if-elif-else)

Function creation (modularizing the bot’s behavior)

String handling and user input

Basic memory with dictionaries

Interactive console design

With its emoji-rich replies and engaging user prompts, this chatbot feels personal, friendly, and practical. It's a perfect beginner-level project that introduces how real-world applications communicate and learn. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of how chatbot engines work — and you’ll have fun building it too!

This is not just a bot — it's your first step toward building intelligent systems!
